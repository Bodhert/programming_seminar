\begin{problem}{Bus}{standard input}{standard output}{bus}

A bus with $n$ passengers opens its door at the bus stop. Exactly half of its passengers and an
additional half of a passenger get out. On the next stop, again, half of the passengers plus half
of a passenger leave the bus. This goes on for $k$ stops in total. Knowing that the bus leaves the
last stop empty, and that no one was hurt during the trip, determine the initial number $n$ of
people in the bus.\\

\InputFile

The first line of input contains the number of test cases $T$. The descriptions of the test cases
follow: The only line of each test case contains the number of stops $k, 1 \leq k \leq 30$.

\OutputFile

For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer - the initial number of bus
passengers.
